# API hook

### Status

[![Publish package to NPM](https://github.com/LarsSK06/api-hook/actions/workflows/publish.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/LarsSK06/api-hook/actions/workflows/npm-publish.yaml)

### What is this?

This is my own personal and preferred API hook made myself for React. This is mainly made to prevent redundancy and version obsolescence across my own projects.


### Why was this created?

To prevent writing the same code across all my projects as well as keeping the scripts up to date.
